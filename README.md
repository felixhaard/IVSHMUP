INFINITY VECTOR SAMPLE GAME  
Felix Haard

Unity 2022.3.5f1

The project is designed to run using a 1:1 aspect ratio. If running in the editor, please set the game view to 1:1.

There are basic tools for easier enemy placement within the editor which can be accessed in the GameScene scene.
Enemy spawner objects determine positioning, spawn time, and movement of their respective enemies. These objects
are all located under the EnemySpawners object. To preview how the enemies they spawn will move and at what times,
simply select the object called ViewPort and scrub it along the y-axis.
